Q1. what is list? how will you reverse a list ?
ans = A list in Python is a versatile data structure used to store a collection of elements. 
It allows you to hold multiple items in a single variable
      ex = original_list = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
           reversed_list = original_list[::-1]
           print(reversed_list)

Q2. How will you remove last object from a list? 
Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [::-1]?

ans = using pop() function will remove last object.
      and list slicing will remove last object list1[-1]

Q3.Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
and = append() adds a single element, while extend() adds multiple elements.
Use append() when you want to add a single item to the end of the list.
Use extend() when you want to add all elements from an iterable to the end of the list individually.

Q4.  How will you compare two lists? 
ans = l1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
l2 = [20, 30, 50, 40, 70]
l1.sort()
l2.sort()
if l1 == l2:
    print("The lists l1 and l2 are the same")
else:
    print("The lists l1 and l2 are not the same")


Q5. What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
ans = 1.Tuples:
A tuple is an immutable data structure in Python.
It represents an ordered collection of elements.
Tuples are created using parentheses () and can contain any type of data (e.g., numbers, strings, other tuples).
Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified or changed.
Tuples are generally used for fixed data, such as coordinates, database records, or function return value.

2.Lists:
A list is a mutable data structure in Python.
It also represents an ordered collection of elements.
Lists are created using square brackets [].
Unlike tuples, lists can be modified (elements added, removed, or changed) after creation.
Lists are commonly used for dynamic data, such as storing user inputs or managing data during program execution.


Q6.How will you create a dictionary using tuples in python?
ans = create a dictionary using tuples in Python by converting a list of tuples 
tuple1 = ("apple", 10)
tuple2 = ("banana", 5)
tuple3 = ("cherry", 8)

my_dict = dict([tuple1, tuple2, tuple3])

print(my_dict)

Q7.How Do You Traverse Through A Dictionary Object In Python? 
ans =1. Using .values() method 
You can iterate through all the values of a dictionary using the .values() method. 
This approach allows you to process or display
 each individual value without explicitly referencing the corresponding keys.

2.Using .keys() method
To access the keys of a dictionary, you can use the built-in .keys() method. 
It returns a view object displaying a list of all the keys in the dictionary.


Q8.How Do You Check The Presence Of A Key In A Dictionary? 
ans = 1.Using the in Operator:
The simplest way to check if a key exists in a dictionary is to use the in operator.
 It evaluates the membership of a value (in this case, the key) and returns True if the key exists or False if it doesnâ€™t.

2.Using the .get() Method:
The .get(key) method retrieves the value associated with the given key.
 If the key exists, it returns the value; otherwise, it returns None.



Q9.Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
and = The zip() function in Python is used to combine two or more iterable dictionaries into a single iterable, 
where corresponding elements from the input iterable are paired together as tuples

Q10.How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?
ans = There are mainly two types of functions in Python. Built-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use. User-defined function:
 We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

Q11.How can you pick a random item from a list or tuple?
ans = enerate a random item from the tuple using random. 
choice() method(This function returns a random element from the specified sequence i.e tuple here) by passing the input 
tuple as an argument to the choice() function. Print the generated random tuple item.

Q12.How can you pick a random item from a range?
ans = Use the random. randrange() function(Returns a random number within the specified range)
 to generate a random number within the given range by passing minimum, and maximum numbers as arguments.


Q13.How can you get a random number in python?
ans = use random. randint(a, b) to generate a random integer between a and b, inclusive.


Q14.How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers? 
ans = The seed() method is used to initialize the random number generator.

Q15.How will you randomizes the items of a list in place?To shuffle a list in Python, 
you can use the shuffle() function from the random module to randomly rearrange elements in a list.
