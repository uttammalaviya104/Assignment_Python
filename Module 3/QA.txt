Q1. what is list? how will you reverse a list ?
ans = A list in Python is a versatile data structure used to store a collection of elements. 
It allows you to hold multiple items in a single variable
      ex = original_list = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
           reversed_list = original_list[::-1]
           print(reversed_list)

Q2. How will you remove last object from a list? 
Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [::-1]?

ans = using pop() function will remove last object.
      and list slicing will remove last object list1[-1]

Q3.Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 
and = append() adds a single element, while extend() adds multiple elements.
Use append() when you want to add a single item to the end of the list.
Use extend() when you want to add all elements from an iterable to the end of the list individually.

Q4.  How will you compare two lists? 
ans = l1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
l2 = [20, 30, 50, 40, 70]
l1.sort()
l2.sort()
if l1 == l2:
    print("The lists l1 and l2 are the same")
else:
    print("The lists l1 and l2 are not the same")
